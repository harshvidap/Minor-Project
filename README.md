Minor Project: An Analysis of student Alcohol Consumption data
 
In this project, I visualized and analyzed a dataset obtained from Kaggle using SPSS, Python, and Rstudio about alcohol consumption among students. 

- I preprocessed the data to remove unwanted columns which were correlated to improve the visualizations. 

- I established the factors that have a significant impact on alcohol consumption among students and generate visualizations to prove the hypothesis.

- The repository contains a SPSS output file and a R-script.  

Note: If you want to run the file then be sure to load the csv files with the data in the same folder. 



PURPOSE: THE REPOSITORY CONTAINS THE DATA OF RESEARCH AND ALL THE IMPORTANT DATA REGARDING TO STUDIES IS UPLOADED INTO THIS REPOSITORY. 
THE REPORT IS MADE UP OF THE STATISTICAL AND THEORETICAL PROOF OF THE FACTORS AFFECTING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION OF STUDENTS AND THEIR GRADES.
